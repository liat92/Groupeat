# Groupeat
A web browser extension that adds functionality to www.10bis.co.il.
This extension assists office users in organizing group orders from 10bis in order to pass the required minimum amount of money that is required for a group order to be made.
This extension was our final project in our Computer Science studies, and is now discontinued.
