If you want to self certify, just execute the files:
createRootCA and createselfsignedcertificate.

If you want to use a CA provider:
1. Run the following commands:
	 sudo apt-get update
	 sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
	 sudo add-apt-repository universe
	 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
	 sudo apt-get update
	 sudo apt-get install certbot
2. Run the following command:
	 certbot certonly --manual
3. Type your domain name(s) without the protocol part. 
   For instance: yourdomain.com or even muchdomain.verysite.
4. Place the file with its content in the path you are requested from certbot (relative to where you start the ssl_server).
5. Run the following command:
	 sudo node ssl_server.js
6. Press enter.
7. When you need to renew the certificates, just start everything again from stage 2.

Note: If you cannot access the /etc/letsencrypt/live folder, just run the following command:
      sudo chmod 755 /etc/letsencrypt/live/
